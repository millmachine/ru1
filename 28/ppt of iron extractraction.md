The iron ore is heated with coke in a blast of hot air, which converts the coke to carbon monoxide, which in turn reduces the iron ore to iron. The limestone is added to remove the silicon dioxide impurities as slag (calcium silicate) 1 Coke reacts with air to form carbon monoxide. 2C(s) + O 2 (g) 2CO(g) 2 Carbon monoxide reduces the iron oxide

## Iron: Guidelines to improve your child's intake
Iron is a mineral everyone needs to keep their body working at its best. Iron works by forming hemoglobin, which is an important part of red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen to all parts of the body. When the body does not have enough iron, a child can develop iron-deficiency anemia. This means the body cells get less oxygen.

Iron is one of the minerals in the human body. If you do not have enough iron, your body cannot make hemoglobin, and you may develop anemia. One way of treating anemia is with intravenous iron, which is delivered into the vein through a needle to increase the levels of iron and hemoglobin in the body.

Below 912 °C (1,674 °F) iron again adopts the BCC structure characteristic of α-iron, also called ferrite. The substance assumes a paramagnetic property. Carbon dissolves poorly in α-iron: no more than 0.021% by mass at 723 °C. As it cools to 770 °C (1,418 °F), the Curie point (T C), the iron is a fairly soft metal and becomes ferromagnetic.

Iron-loaded transferrin binds to transferrin receptor 1 on the surface of most body cells, and after endocytosis of the complex, iron enters the cytoplasm via DMT1 in the endosomal membrane. This iron can be used for metabolic functions, stored within cytosolic ferritin, or exported from the cell via FPN1.
