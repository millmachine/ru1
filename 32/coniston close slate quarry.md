## Old Man of Coniston
The Old Man of Coniston is the inspiration for the so-called Kanchenjunga, the Lake District mountain Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons climb in the Swallows and Amazons novel Swallowdale. The slate quarries and copper mines inspired Pigeon Post, a later novel in the same series.

## In Pursuit of the Quarry: Pennsylvania's Slate Belt 
In the Slate Belt, the mineral content led to the familiar dark blue-gray color. Due to slate's durability and resistance to hard wear, slate production became profitable in the Slate Belt for a myriad of uses. Blackboards, slate gravestones, and miniature slate boards for use in classrooms of the time were significant uses of the rock.

Hodge Close Quarry, Coniston This disused slate quarry is now a mecca for rock climbers seeking E-graded sports routes. We had taken climbing kit with us, but alas slate is a slippery as ice when even slightly wet, and in this case, water was streaming down these the bolted climbing routes.

Coniston is a good centre for walkers and climbers, and those wanting to investigate the Tilberthwaite Slate quarries. Until the copper mines, dating from Jacobean times, were revitalised about 1859, Coniston was a scattered rural community.

Slate tile, like all natural stone, is difficult to cut without special tools. in addition, the subfloor and underlayment preparation must be done very carefully to prevent the flexing that can cause cracking of the grout joints or the tiles themselves. For this reason, it is usually best to have pros install slate .

Just one of many slate workings in the Tilberthwaite Valley, near Langdale. This was worked on a large scale from the 19th century to the early 60s (small scale).
