The only thing that can distract these mice from their work excavating the quarry is delicious queso! The spicier the cheese, the further into the quarry the scent seems to penetrate, bringing more powerful mice up from the depths, looking to taste the mouthwateringly-spiced queso.

## Quarry Sorting | Feed the Beast
May 27, 2013· On my FTB world I made a quarry with a steady power source using lava, I would run it but it is a big quarry and I don't know how to sort it's output, I am most likely going to use a bunch of barrels but if I get a better suggestion I will use it. Please leave any good quarry sorting ideas you have.

Quarries can be powered using MJ, BuildCraft's form of power, or EU, IndustrialCraft's form of power. When using MJ to power a Quarry, Engines must be used. Any type of engines can be used, but Steam Engines are a good idea. Redstone Engines are rather slow, and with Combustion Engines there is a good chance you Quarry will explode.

## Sand as a (Superior) Substrate | Advanced Aquarium Concepts
Sand as a substrate has many advantages over gravel. Sand is more natural, easier to clean, and looks much better. Sand is Much More Natural than Gravel: Almost all the fish we keep in aquariums are from waters that naturally have a flow much lower than would allow gravel as a substrate. Most will have a substrate of sand, some even silt or mud (which we can't have in an aquarium).

## The Day We Switched Polymeric Sand
We did, in one of our last projects to use TechniSeal brand polymeric sand. There was a very light rain the next day, and the New and Improved polymeric sand with it's ability to re-soften, left the joints of the walkway and went into the grass and driveway. Apologizing profusely, we returned, cleaned things up and re-applied new sand.
